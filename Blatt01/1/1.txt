DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, util‐
       ity or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and  displayed.   A
       section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to
       search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order ("1 n l 8 3  0  2  5  4  9  6  7"  by
       default,  unless  overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/man_db.conf), and to show only the first page
       found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.


       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names  include  NAME,  SYNOPSIS,  CONFIGURATION,  DESCRIPTION,  OPTIONS,  EXIT STATUS,
       RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,  CONFORMING TO,  NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and
       SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.


       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually  not  be  able  to
       render italics when running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The  command  or  function  illustration  is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some
       cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the  SYNOPSIS  section  of
       this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man -a intro
           Display,  in  succession,  all  of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is
           possible to quit between successive displays or skip any of them.

       man -t alias | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page referenced by `alias', usually a shell manual page, into the  default  troff  or
           groff  format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually PostScript.
           man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device indepen‐
           dent  (dvi)  file.   The redirection is necessary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout
           with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into  Post‐
           Script using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search  the  short  descriptions  and  manual  page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.
           Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos -r printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equiva‐
           lent to whatis -r smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options  are  available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes
       can be made to the search path, section order,  output  processor,  and  other  behaviours  and  operations
       detailed below.

       If  set,  various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible
       to set the `catch all' variable $MANOPT to any string in command line format with the  exception  that  any
       spaces  used  as  part  of  an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man will parse
       $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be  overridden  by
       the  same  options found on the command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be speci‐
       fied as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to `forget' about the  options  specified  in
       $MANOPT although they must still have been valid.

       The  manual  pager  utilities packaged as man-db make extensive use of index database caches.  These caches
       contain information such as where each manual page can be found on  the  filesystem  and  what  its  whatis
       (short one line description of the man page) contains, and allow man to run faster than if it had to search
       the filesystem each time to find the appropriate manual page.  If requested using the -u option,  man  will
       ensure  that  the  caches  remain consistent, which can obviate the need to manually run software to update
       traditional whatis text databases.

       If man cannot find a mandb initiated index database for a particular manual page hierarchy, it  will  still
       search for the requested manual pages, although file globbing will be necessary to search within that hier‐
       archy.  If whatis or apropos fails to find an index it will try to extract information from  a  traditional
       whatis database instead.

       These utilities support compressed source nroff files having, by default, the extensions of .Z, .z and .gz.
       It is possible to deal with any compression extension, but this information must be known at compile  time.
       Also,  by  default,  any cat pages produced are compressed using gzip.  Each `global' manual page hierarchy
       such as /usr/share/man or /usr/X11R6/man may have any directory as its cat page  hierarchy.   Traditionally
       the cat pages are stored under the same hierarchy as the man pages, but for reasons such as those specified
       in the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS), it may be better to store them elsewhere.  For details on how  to  do
       this, please read manpath(5).  For details on why to do this, read the standard.

       International  support  is  available  with  this package.  Native language manual pages are accessible (if
       available on your system) via use of locale functions.  To activate such support, it is  necessary  to  set
       either  $LC_MESSAGES,  $LANG or another system dependent environment variable to your language locale, usu‐
       ally specified in the POSIX 1003.1 based format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in  lieu  of  the  standard  (usually
       American English) page.

       Support  for  international message catalogues is also featured in this package and can be activated in the
       same way, again if available.  If you find that the manual pages and message catalogues supplied with  this
       package  are  not  available  in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please  read  the
       documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       man will search for the desired manual pages within the index database caches. If the -u option is given, a
       cache consistency check is performed to ensure the databases accurately reflect the  filesystem.   If  this
       option  is always given, it is not generally necessary to run mandb after the caches are initially created,
       unless a cache becomes corrupt.  However, the cache consistency check can be slow on systems with many man‐
       ual  pages  installed,  so  it is not performed by default, and system administrators may wish to run mandb
       every week or so to keep the database caches fresh.  To forestall problems caused by outdated  caches,  man
       will fall back to file globbing if a cache lookup fails, just as it would if no cache was present.

       Once a manual page has been located, a check is performed to find out if a relative preformatted `cat' file
       already exists and is newer than the nroff file.  If it does and is, this preformatted  file  is  (usually)
       decompressed  and  then  displayed, via use of a pager.  The pager can be specified in a number of ways, or
       else will fall back to a default is used (see option -P for details).  If no cat is found or is older  than
       the nroff file, the nroff is filtered through various programs and is shown immediately.

       If  a  cat file can be produced (a relative cat directory exists and has appropriate permissions), man will
       compress and store the cat file in the background.

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p  or  the  environment
       variable  $MANROFFSEQ  is  interrogated.   If -p was not used and the environment variable was not set, the
       initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a  preprocessor  string.   To  contain  a  valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and
       executed.  Alternatively, if an executable program mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t)  exists  in  the  man
       tree  root,  it  is  executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and
       optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not  harmful.
       For options that require an argument, each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This  option  is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.
              Its use is to reset those options that may have been set in $MANOPT.  Any  options  that  follow  -D
              will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual
              pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of warning names; if it is not supplied, the  default  is
              "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent  to  whatis.   Display  a  short  description  from  the  manual page, if available.  See
              whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page  descriptions  for  keywords  and  display  any
              matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time;
              if you can, you should specify a section to reduce the number of pages that  need  to  be  searched.
              Search  terms  may  be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate `local' mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the  sys‐
              tem's  manual  collection.  Each manual page argument will be interpreted as an nroff source file in
              the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input  will
              be  taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before
              displaying the error message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a
              filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s) of the source nroff files that
              would be formatted.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s) of the cat files that would be
              displayed.  If -w and -W are both specified, print both separated by a space.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified
              encoding.  If you already know the encoding  of  the  source  file,  you  can  also  use  manconv(1)
              directly.   However,  this  option  allows  you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding
              without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were  already  installed
              in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man  will  normally  determine  your  current  locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which
              interrogates various environment variables, possibly including $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporar‐
              ily  override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such  as  the  help
              message will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this
              option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To  include  a
              search  of  the  native operating system's manual pages, include the system name man in the argument
              string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived  code  to  determine  the
              path  to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be
              ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured  into  sections
              as  described  in  the man-db manual (under "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside
              such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              List is a colon- or comma-separated list of `order specific' manual sections to search.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some  systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl pack‐
              age, into the main manual page hierarchy.  To get around the problem of having two manual pages with
              the  same  name  such  as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to  assign  a  specific
              `extension'  to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Under normal operation, man will display exit(3) in
              preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section the
              page  you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which
              package the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to  man  will
              restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument
              as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable  way  to  pick  a
              "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument
              using shell-style wildcards, as with apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire
              name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no rea‐
              sonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions,  as  with
              whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit  after  displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this
              option forces man to display all the manual pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to perform an `inode level' consistency  check  on  its  database  caches  to
              ensure  that  they  are  an  accurate  representation of the filesystem.  It will only have a useful
              effect if man is installed with the setuid bit set.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equiv‐
              alent  to  a single manual page name containing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common
              pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide  manual  pages
              for  each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands them‐
              selves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses less -s.  This option overrides  the  $MAN‐
              PAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used
              in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (back‐
              slashes,  single  quotes,  or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if
              you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensi‐
              ble options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x  the  cur‐
              rent line number.  This is achieved by using the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying  -r  with  a  string  will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN
              which will be expanded to the name of the current manual page and its section name surrounded by `('
              and `)'.  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It  is  broken  into  three  lines  here  for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the
              less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evaluated by the shell.  All double  quotes,  back-
              quotes  and  backslashes  in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string
              may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets  the
              -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none
              is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator,  some  characters
              may  not  display correctly when using the latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option
              allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1  text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may
              only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.


              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      ·        o
              acute accent           264      '        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and  this
              option  is  not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page
              using this option or man did not format this page using  the  latin1  device  description.   If  the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This  option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than
              GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encod‐
              ing  may be an nroff device such as ascii, latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such
              as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do  not  contain
              hyphens,  if  it  is  necessary to do so to lay out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This
              option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be  hyphenated  if  they  already  contain
              hyphens.

              If  you  are  writing  a  manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an
              inappropriate point, do not use this option,  but  consult  the  nroff  documentation  instead;  for
              instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or put
              "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justifi‐
              cation, leaving justified only to the left margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If  you  are  writing  a  manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain para‐
              graphs, do not use this option, but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance,  you  can
              use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the  sequence  of  preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations
              will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to  designate
              them  are:  eqn  (e),  grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option overrides the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required  in  conjunction
              with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option  is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other
              than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (provided with  Groff-1.17)  include  dvi,  latin1,  ps,
              utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.
              The choice of browser is determined by the optional browser argument if  one  is  provided,  by  the
              $BROWSER  environment  variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi
              (dots  per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point
              base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable  for  the
              chosen  device.  If groff -mandoc is groff, this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use
              of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              The contents of $MANROFFOPT are added to the command line  every  time  man  invokes  the  formatter
              (nroff, troff, or groff).

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual
              page through.  The default preprocessor list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and  it  is  used  to  determine
              which manual sections to search and in what order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 0 2 5 4 9 6 7", unless
              overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/man_db.conf.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as  the  name  of
              the program used to display the manual page.  By default, less -s is used.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (back‐
              slashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect  multiple  commands;  if
              you  need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it
              had  been passed using the -r option (so any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the
              same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt string”,
              set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used
              to try to start a web browser for man --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by  a  filename  con‐
              taining  the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced
              by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument  to  the
              -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar
              format.  As all of the other man specific environment variables can be  expressed  as  command  line
              options,  and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will become
              obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part  of  an  option's  argument  must  be
              escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH  is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be format‐
              ted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be formatted with a line length appropriate to the current
              terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, an ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters if
              neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be  used,  that
              is when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting
              characters are discarded to make it easier to read the result without special  tools.   However,  if
              $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING  is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are retained.  This
              may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any  error  output  from
              the  command  used  to  produce formatted versions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering
              with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often  produce  relatively  minor  error  messages
              about  typographical  problems  such  as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing
              when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some users want to  see  them  anyway,  so,  if
              $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending  on  system  and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interro‐
              gated for the current message locale.  man will display its messages in that locale (if  available).
              See setlocale(3) for precise details.

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none
       of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

       --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of  1,048,576
              bytes; see SIZE format below

       -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

       -c     with  -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file status information); with -l:
              show ctime and sort by name; otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first

       -C     list entries by columns

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize the output; WHEN can be 'never', 'auto', or 'always' (the default); more info below

       -d, --directory
              list directories themselves, not their contents

       -D, --dired
              generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode

       -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color

       -F, --classify
              append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries

       --file-type
              likewise, except do not append '*'

       --group-directories-first
              group directories before files;

              can be augmented with a --sort option, but any use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping

       -G, --no-group
              in a long listing, don't print group names

       -h, --human-readable
              with -l and/or -s, print human readable sizes (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       --si   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -H, --dereference-command-line
              follow symbolic links listed on the command line

       --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir

       --indicator-style=WORD
              append  indicator  with  style  WORD  to  entry  names:  none  (default),  slash   (-p),   file-type
              (--file-type), classify (-F)

       -i, --inode
              print the index number of each file

              do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN

       -k, --kibibytes
              default to 1024-byte blocks for disk usage

       -l     use a long listing format

       -L, --dereference
              when showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for the file the link references
              rather than for the link itself

       -m     fill width with a comma separated list of entries

       -n, --numeric-uid-gid
              like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs

       -N, --literal
              print raw entry names (don't treat e.g. control characters specially)

       -p, --indicator-style=slash
              append / indicator to directories

       -q, --hide-control-chars
              print ? instead of nongraphic characters

       --show-control-chars
              show nongraphic characters as-is (the default, unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)

       -Q, --quote-name
              enclose entry names in double quotes

       --quoting-style=WORD
              use quoting style WORD for entry names: literal, locale, shell, shell-always, c, escape

       -r, --reverse
              reverse order while sorting

       -R, --recursive
              list subdirectories recursively

       -s, --size
              print the allocated size of each file, in blocks

       -S     sort by file size

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time: atime or access or use  (-u)  ctime
              or status (-c); also use specified time as sort key if --sort=time

       --time-style=STYLE
              with -l, show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT; FORMAT is inter‐
              preted like in 'date'; if FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,  then  FORMAT1  applies  to  non-recent
              files  and FORMAT2 to recent files; if STYLE is prefixed with 'posix-', STYLE takes effect only out‐
              side the POSIX locale

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and  sort  by  name;  otherwise:
              sort by access time

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              assume screen width instead of current value

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -Z, --context
              print any security context of each file

       -1     list one file per line

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  SIZE  argument  is  an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y
       (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

       Using color to  distinguish  file  types  is  disabled  both  by  default  and  with  --color=never.   With
       --color=auto,  ls  emits  color  codes only when standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS
       environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file associ‐
       ated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the
              timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change  the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime:
              equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

       <http://translationproject.org/team/>

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a  mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42
       -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calen‐
       dar  date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string
       indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format is more complex than is easily documented  here
       but is fully described in the info documentation.

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if  an  existing  destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored
              when the -n option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve the specified  attributes  (default:  mode,ownership,timestamps),  if  possible  additional
              attributes: context, links, xattr, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy  only  when  the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is
              missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file  is  made
       sparse  as  well.   That  is  the  behavior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a
       sparse DEST  file  whenever  the  SOURCE  file  contains  a  long  enough  sequence  of  zero  bytes.   Use
       --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always]  is  specified,  perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only
       when modified.  If this is not possible the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back  to  a
       standard copy.

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may
       be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the val‐
       ues:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and
       DEST are the same name for an existing, regular file.

RM(1)                                              User Commands                                             RM(1)



NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not
       remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files  or  the  -r,  -R,  or
       --recursive  are  given, then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the
       response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the  -f  or  --force  option  is  not
       given,  or  the  -i  or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the
       file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive than
              -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing  a  hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from
              that of the corresponding command line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root
              do not remove '/' (default)

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option to  remove  each  listed
       directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given suf‐
       ficient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly  unrecoverable,  consider
       using shred.
